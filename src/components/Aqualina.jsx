            <h2>Aqualina</h2>

            <h4>Overview</h4>

            <p>Aqualina is a website that allows users to make hotel reservations as members of the elite beach resort (Aqualina). 
                This project focused on creating a new hotel booking website, aimed at offering a seamless and intuitive user experience (UX) with a modern and 
                engaging user interface (UI). The objective was to build a platform that makes the process of making reservations, scheduling dinners, and 
                purchasing event tickets straightforward and enjoyable for members, leveraging insights from user research and the industry's best practices. 
                Also, to make the membership process seamless for new users.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>

            <p>My role was to research and design all interfaces (website, customer portal, and admin portal) related to the project. 
                I collaborated with the project management team to create the UI design.

            <h3>User Interview</h3>
            <p>I conducted interviews with users that have experience booking rooms and hotel services in order to tailor the needs and preferences of the 
              intended audience so as to deliver a positive and optimal user experience.  Below are some of the questions asked.   </p>

                  <li>A lot of users highlighted simplified booking steps, short form fields, and use progress indicators to make the process user-friendly.</li>

            <h1>Ideate</h1>
            
            <h3>Sitemap</h3>
            <p>By narrowing the features necessary for Aqualina to function through research and interviews, I then created a site map to organize the pages, information, and navigation of the website and customer portal.</p>
            <img src="" alt="" />

            <h3>User Flow</h3>
            <p>To further define users’ actions, we created user flows for different features to gain a better understanding of how users will use it.</p>
            <img src="" alt="" />

            <h1>Design</h1>
            
            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>I started with sketching my designs on paper, after getting a better design direction I continued with low-fidelity wireframes to get a clearer structure of the web pages and evaluate them with our stakeholders and product team. This helped me work rapidly and led me to consider more ideas. Sketching many concepts helped me form a broader view of the system earlier ensuring a more cohesive design..</p>
            <img src="" alt="" />

            <h3>High-Fidelity Design & Prototyping</h3>
            <p>After creating the wireframes, I moved on to create the high-fidelity designs on Figma as well as prototype. I ensured I carried the stakeholders along during this process by scheduling a meeting bi-weekly after each  expected deliverable, this allowed for a fast feedback process. After each presentation, based off feedback from the stakeholders and product manager I iterated the designs and continued the feedback process until the stakeholders were satisfied with the deliverables.</p>
            <img src="" alt="" />

            <div>
                <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>It helped me better understand the pain point of users interacting with hotel websites and a better knowledge of the hospitality industry. It was also a fun and new experience.</li>
                  <li>During the user research process, it revealed contradictory preferences among different user segments. For example, some users prioritized simplicity and ease of use, while others preferred more advanced features and customization options.</li>
                  <li>The project faced challenges, but the most difficult piece was the inadequate documentation from the product team and the delayed communication in regards to feedback. Thankfully, we were able to be more flexible with our timing so as for everyone to be present when needed.</li>
                  <li>While the whole project was a huge learning experience, I especially loved the research aspect which helped take the ambiguity out of our designs, also loved the moodboarding and sketching, it felt good seeing my concepts come into high-fidelity design.</li>
                </ul>
